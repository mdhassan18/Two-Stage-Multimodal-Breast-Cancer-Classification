# Two-Stage-Multimodal-Breast-Cancer-Classification
A two-stage deep learning framework for breast cancer analysis. Stage-1 performs high-sensitivity screening, while Stage-2 conducts multimodal diagnosis using mammograms, ultrasound images, and clinical metadata with attention-based late fusion. Model interpretability is achieved via Grad-CAM++ and modality-level attention weights.
